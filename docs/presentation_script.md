>
> Let's dive into what we built!"

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Introduction of team
- ✅ Assignment overview
- ✅ Frameworks mentioned

---

### TASK 1: IRIS CLASSIFICATION (0:20 - 0:50) - Member 2

**[Show: Iris dataset visualization and confusion matrix]**

> "First, we tackled classical machine learning with Scikit-learn. Using the famous Iris dataset, we trained and compared five different classification models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM.
>
> **[Point to visualizations]**
>
> After hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, our optimized model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set. Feature importance analysis revealed that petal measurements are significantly more discriminative than sepal measurements.
>
> This project demonstrates Scikit-learn's strength: easy to use, fast training, and perfect for structured data."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Task explained
- ✅ Methodology mentioned (multiple models, tuning)
- ✅ Results stated (100% accuracy)
- ✅ Insight shared (petal vs sepal)
- ✅ Framework strength highlighted

---

### TASK 2: MNIST DEEP LEARNING (0:50 - 1:25) - Member 3

**[Show: CNN architecture diagram and training curves]**

> "Next, we built a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
>
> **[Show architecture]**
>
> Our custom CNN architecture includes two convolutional blocks with batch normalization and dropout for regularization. We implemented data augmentation—including rotation and shifting—to improve generalization.
>
> **[Show training curves]**
>
> The results? We achieved 98.7% test accuracy, exceeding the 95% target! The model trains in about 8 minutes and contains approximately 220,000 parameters.
>
> **[Show confusion matrix briefly]**
>
> Our error analysis shows that most mistakes occur on ambiguous or poorly written digits. TensorFlow proved excellent for this unstructured data, with automatic feature learning and GPU acceleration."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Task and framework explained
- ✅ Architecture described
- ✅ Techniques mentioned (augmentation, regularization)
- ✅ Strong results (98.7%)
- ✅ Error analysis mentioned
- ✅ Framework advantages stated

---

### TASK 3: NLP SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (1:25 - 1:55) - Member 4

**[Show: Word clouds and sentiment distribution]**

> "For our third task, we performed Natural Language Processing on Amazon product reviews using spaCy and VADER sentiment analysis.
>
> **[Show entity extraction results]**
>
> SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition automatically extracted 96 entities including brands like Apple, Samsung, and Sony, plus product names and prices—something impossible with basic string operations.
>
> **[Show word clouds]**
>
> Our sentiment analysis classified reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. These word clouds show that positive reviews emphasize words like 'amazing,' 'excellent,' and 'perfect,' while negative reviews focus on 'terrible,' 'awful,' and 'disappointing.'
>
> **[Show brand sentiment chart if available]**
>
> Interestingly, premium brands consistently received more positive sentiment than generic brands. SpaCy's production-ready NLP capabilities made this analysis fast and accurate."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Task and tools explained
- ✅ NER capabilities demonstrated
- ✅ Sentiment results shown
- ✅ Insights shared (premium vs generic brands)
- ✅ SpaCy advantages mentioned

### BONUS: STREAMLIT DEPLOYMENT (1:55 - 2:15) - Member 5

**[Show: Live Streamlit app or recorded demo]**

> "We didn't stop at training models—we deployed our MNIST classifier as a web application using Streamlit!
>
> **[Demo the app]**
>
> Users can upload their own digit images or test on random samples. The app shows real-time predictions with confidence scores and probability distributions for all ten digits.
>
> **[Show confidence visualization]**
>
> The color-coded confidence levels—green for high, orange for medium, red for low—help users understand the model's certainty. This demonstrates how quickly we can go from research to production with modern tools like Streamlit."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Deployment mentioned
- ✅ Features demonstrated
- ✅ User experience highlighted
- ✅ Quick demo shown

---

### ETHICS & KEY LEARNINGS (2:15 - 2:45) - Member 1 or 2

**[Show: Key points slide]**

> "Beyond implementation, we conducted a thorough ethical analysis of our models.
>
> We identified several potential biases: in MNIST, the dataset overrepresents certain handwriting styles and demographics. In our sentiment analysis, brand reputation influences review sentiment independently of product quality.
>
> **[Show mitigation strategies if time]**
>
> Our mitigation strategies include data augmentation, diverse dataset collection, and continuous fairness monitoring using tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators.
>
> We also completed a debugging challenge, fixing eight common TensorFlow errors including shape mismatches, incorrect loss functions, and missing batch dimensions—skills crucial for real-world development."

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Ethics addressed
- ✅ Biases identified
- ✅ Mitigation strategies mentioned
- ✅ Debugging skills demonstrated

**Member 4:**
> "Achieved 100% accuracy on Iris, 98.7% on MNIST,"

**Member 5:**
> "Performed comprehensive NLP analysis,"

**Member 1:**
